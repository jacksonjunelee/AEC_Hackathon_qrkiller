# Imprint (AEC Hackathon)
The "Imprint" project presents a solution to replace QR codes with embedded, design-integrated visual links. Criticizing QR codes as disruptive and unreadable, it utilizes computer vision and image segmentation across platforms like web frontends, device frontends, and a Revit add-in to embed information directly within images. By generating data embeddings from processed images and employing techniques like image augmentation and feature extraction, Imprint enables drawings and photos to function as interactive, linkable elementsâ€”eliminating the need for traditional QR codes.
